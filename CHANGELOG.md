  `Job.update_metadata` for more details (@gpetretto, #198)
- Additional stores are now generated on the fly as memory stores if they are not
  specified in jobflow settings (@davidwaroquiers, #183)

Bug fixes:

  used to create new directories.

  nested nature of flows with the outer flow always first in the list (@gpetretto).

Bug fixes:

- Docstring clarifications (@utf, @mjwen).

## v0.1.7

New features:

## v0.1.4

New features:

- Add `append_name` option to `Job` and `Flow` that allow easy modification of all
  job names in a flow.
- Add `JobConfig.pass_metadata` (defaults to True) that can be used to pass job metadata
  on to dynamically added jobs.

Bug fixes:

- Fireworks manager now adds metadata to FireWork spec. Fixes #21.

## v0.1.3

Jobflow now uses pydantic to handle settings. Currently, there is only a single setting
`JOB_STORE` which controls the default store used by `run_locally` and the fireworks
manager. You can update the default store by writing a `~/.jobflow.yaml` settings
file. See the API documentation for more details.

## v0.1.2

New features:

- `ensure_success` option added to `run_locally`.
- Better graph visualisation.
- Updating the name of a job from a maker now propagates the name change to the maker.
- `Job.update_maker_kwargs` with `nested=True` now applies the updates to makers
  in the kwargs or args of the job.

## v0.1.1

Docs updates.

## v0.1.0

Major changes:

- `Schema` class removed. Any pydantic model can now be an output schema.

Enhancements:

- `JobStore.get_output` now resolves references in the output of other jobs.
- `JobStore.get_output`: `which` now supports specifying a specific job index.
- Better support for circular and missing references in `JobStore.get_output` and
  `OutputReference.resolve`.
- Update dependencies to use latest jsanitize features.

Bug fixes:

- Fixed issue with references in flow of flows (@davidwaroquiers, #18).
- Makes now allows non-default parameters (fixes: #13).
- Fix reference cache with multiple indexes.

## v0.0.2

Testing automated releases.

## v0.0.1

Initial release containing:

- `Job`, `Flow`, `Maker`, and `JobStore` API.
- Tools for running Flows locally.
- Fireworks integration.
