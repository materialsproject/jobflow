@dataclass
class Maker(MSONable):
    """
    Base maker (factory) class for constructing :obj:`Job` and :obj:`Flow` objects.

    Note, this class is only an abstract implementation. To create a functioning Maker,
    one should  subclass :obj:`Maker`, define the ``make`` method and add a name field
    with a default value. See examples below.

    See Also
    --------
    .job, .Job, .Flow

    Examples
    --------
    Below we define a simple maker that generates a job to add two numbers. Next, we
    make a job using the maker. When creating a new maker it is essential to: 1)
    Add a name field with a default value (this controls the name of jobs produced
    by the maker) and 2) override the ``make`` method with a concrete implementation.

    >>> from dataclasses import dataclass
    >>> from jobflow import Maker, job
    >>> @dataclass
    ... class AddMaker(Maker):
    ...     name: str = "add"
    ...
    ...     @job
    ...     def make(self, a, b):
    ...         return a + b
    >>> maker = AddMaker()
    >>> add_job = maker.make(1, 2)
    >>> add_job.name
    "add"

    There are two key features of :obj:`Maker` objects that make them extremely
    powerful. The first is the ability to have class instance variables that
    are used inside the make function. For example, running the job below will produce
    the output ``6.5``.

    >>> @dataclass
    ... class AddMaker(Maker):
    ...     name: str = "add"
    ...     c: float = 1.5
    ...
    ...     @job
    ...     def make(self, a, b):
    ...         return a + b + self.c
    >>> maker = AddMaker(c=3.5)
    >>> add_job = maker.make(1, 2)

    .. Note::
        Jobs created by a Maker will inherit a copy of the Maker object. This means that
        if 1) a job is created, 2) the maker variables are changed, and 3) a new job is
        created, only the second job will reflect the updated maker variables.

    The second useful feature is the ability for delayed creation of jobs. For example,
    consider a job that creates another job during its execution. If the new job
    has lots of optional arguments, this will require passing lots of arguments to the
    first job. However, using a Maker, the kwargs of the job can be specified as maker
    kwargs and specified when the first job is created, making it much cleaner to
    customise the newly created job. For example, consider this job that first squares
    two numbers, then creates a new job to add them.

    >>> from jobflow import Response
    >>> @dataclass
    ... class SquareThenAddMaker(Maker):
    ...     name: str = "square then add"
    ...     add_maker: Maker = AddMaker()
    ...
    ...     @job
    ...     def make(self, a, b):
    ...         a_squared = a ** 2
    ...         b_squared = b ** 2
    ...         add_job = self.add_maker.make(a_squared, b_squared)
    ...         return Response(detour=add_job)
    >>> maker = SquareThenAddMaker()
    >>> square_add_job = maker.make(3, 4)

    The add job can be customised by specifying a custom ``AddMaker`` instance when
    the ``SquareThenAddMaker`` is initialized.

    >>> custom_add_maker = AddMaker(c=1000)
    >>> maker = SquareThenAddMaker(add_maker=custom_add_maker)

    This provides a very natural way to contain and control the kwargs for dynamically
    created jobs.

    Note that makers can also be used to create :obj:`Flow` objects. In this case,
    the only difference is that the ``make()`` method is not decorated using the ``job``
    decorator and the function should return a flow. For example:

    >>> from jobflow import Flow
    >>> @dataclass
    ... class DoubleAddMaker(Maker):
    ...     name: str = "double add"
    ...     add_maker: Maker = AddMaker()
    ...
    ...     def make(self, a, b):
    ...         add_first = self.add_maker.make(a, b)
    ...         add_second = self.add_maker.make(add_first.output, b)
    ...         return Flow([add_first, add_second], name=self.name)
    >>> maker = DoubleAddMaker()
    >>> double_add_job = maker.make(1, 2)

        Update the keyword arguments of the :obj:`.Maker`.

        .. Note::
            Note, the maker is not updated in place. Instead a new maker object is
            returned.

        Parameters
        ----------
        update
            The updates to apply.
        name_filter
            A filter for the Maker name. Only Makers with a matching name will be
            updated. Includes partial matches, e.g. "ad" will match a Maker with the
            name "adder".
        class_filter
            A filter for the maker class. Only Makers with a matching class will be
            updated. Note the class filter will match any subclasses.
        nested
            Whether to apply the updates to Maker objects that are themselves kwargs
            of a Maker object. See examples for more details.
        dict_mod
            Use the dict mod language to apply updates. See :obj:`.DictMods` for more
            details.

        Examples
        --------
        Consider the following Maker:

        >>> from dataclasses import dataclass
        >>> from jobflow import job, Maker
        >>> @dataclass
        ... class AddMaker(Maker):
        ...     name: str = "add"
        ...     number: float = 10
        ...
        ...     @job
        ...     def make(self, a):
        ...         return a + self.number
        >>> maker = AddMaker()

        The ``number`` argument could be updated using:

        >>> maker.update_kwargs({"number": 10})

        By default, the updates are applied to nested Makers. These are Makers
        which are present in the kwargs of another Maker. For example, consider this
        maker that first squares a number, then creates a new job to add it.

        >>> from jobflow import Response
        >>> @dataclass
        ... class SquareThenAddMaker(Maker):
        ...     name: str = "square then add"
        ...     add_maker: Maker = AddMaker()
        ...
        ...     @job
        ...     def make(self, a, b):
        ...         a_squared = a ** 2
        ...         add_job = self.add_maker.make(a_squared)
        ...         return Response(detour=add_job)
        >>> maker = SquareThenAddMaker()

        The following update will apply to the nested ``AddMaker`` in the kwargs of the
        ``SquareThenAddMaker``:

        >>> maker = maker.update_kwargs({"number": 10}, class_filter=AddMaker)

        However, if ``nested=False``, then the update will not be applied to the nested
        Maker:

        >>> maker = maker.update_kwargs(
        ...     {"number": 10}, class_filter=AddMaker, nested=False
        ... )
